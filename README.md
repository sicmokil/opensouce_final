# opensouce_final

I tried as many models as possible and in this dataset, linear and SVM, MLP works better than other models like decision tree, random forest etc.
Hence I find proper parameters forseveral SVM models and linear models, and some other models, and finally I choose to use soft voting and hard voting
to increase overall accuracy. Since the nunber of models are about 7, accuracy increases well. 

Hence the final accuracy is about 99.17%
