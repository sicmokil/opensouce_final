I tried as many models as possible and in this dataset, makes bit mess in code, but it turns out linear and SVM, MLP works better than other models like decision tree, random forest etc. Thus I find proper parameters for several SVM models and linear models, and some other models, and finally I choose to use soft voting and hard voting
to increase overall accuracy. Since the nunber of models are about 7, accuracy increases well. 

The final accuracy is about 99.17%
